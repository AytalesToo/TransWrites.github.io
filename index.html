    <h1>What is Trans Writes?</h1>
    
    <p>We are a board for trans folk by trans folk. Our resources are silo'd. Our communities small and marginalized. I want any trans person to be able to easily find resources and community that supports and celebrate them. We are here. We are loud. We are proud. We are united in solidtarity.</o>
